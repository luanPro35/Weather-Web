# Best Practices for Weather-Web PHP Code

## Code Organization

### 1. Use Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

The codebase has been restructured to use classes for better organization and maintainability:

- `Database.php`: Handles database connections and operations
- `User.php`: Manages user authentication and user-related operations
- `helpers.php`: Contains utility functions used throughout the application

### 2. Follow a Consistent Directory Structure

```
php/
├── classes/           # Class files (consider moving classes here)
├── config.php         # Configuration file
├── helpers.php        # Helper functions
├── logs/              # Log files (auto-created)
├── vendor/            # Composer dependencies
├── .env               # Environment variables (not in version control)
├── .env.example       # Example environment file
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

- **NEVER** hardcode sensitive information in your code
- Use the `.env` file for all sensitive configuration
- The `.env` file should **NEVER** be committed to version control
- Always provide an up-to-date `.env.example` file

### 2. Database Security

- Always use prepared statements for database queries
- Use the `Database` class for all database operations
- Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries

### 3. User Authentication

- Use the `User` class for all user-related operations
- Implement proper session management
- Use CSRF protection for forms

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate all user input
- Use the `h()` helper function to prevent XSS attacks
- Sanitize output before displaying it to users

## Error Handling

### 1. Use Try-Catch Blocks

```php
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle the exception
    app_log("Error: " . $e->getMessage(), "error");
    
    // Show appropriate error message to user
    if (is_development()) {
        echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
    } else {
        echo "An error occurred. Please try again later.";
    }
}
```

### 2. Logging

- Use the `app_log()` function for logging
- Log all errors and important events
- Check logs regularly for issues

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database Optimization

- Use indexes for frequently queried columns
- Minimize the number of database queries
- Use the `fetchOne()` method when you only need one row

### 2. Caching

- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Use output buffering for complex pages

## Code Style

### 1. Naming Conventions

- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `Database`, `User`)
- Methods and functions: camelCase (e.g., `getById`, `fetchOne`)
- Variables: camelCase (e.g., `$userData`, `$logFile`)
- Constants: UPPER_CASE (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `APP_ENV`)

### 2. Documentation

- Use PHPDoc comments for classes, methods, and functions
- Document parameters, return types, and exceptions
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### 3. Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces recommended)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions and methods small and focused

## Testing

### 1. Manual Testing

- Test all features thoroughly before deployment
- Test with different browsers and devices
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios

### 2. Automated Testing

- Consider implementing unit tests for critical functionality
- Use PHPUnit or similar testing framework

## Deployment

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- Set `APP_ENV` to `production`
- Enable `ENABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION`
- Update all dependencies
- Remove any debugging code
- Check for hardcoded credentials

### 2. Monitoring

- Implement error logging and monitoring
- Regularly check logs for issues
- Set up alerts for critical errors

## Maintenance

### 1. Regular Updates

- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Regularly check for security vulnerabilities
- Update documentation as needed

### 2. Code Reviews

- Conduct regular code reviews
- Follow these best practices for all new code
- Refactor existing code to follow these practices when possible
